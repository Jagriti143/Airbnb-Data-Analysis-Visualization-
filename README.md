"🎓✨ Exploring New York City's Airbnb Market: A Tableau Data Analysis Project ✨🎓
Excited to share my recent project, completed as part of my learning journey at Lovely Professional University (LPU)! This deep dive into NYC’s Airbnb market showcases the power of data visualization in uncovering trends and patterns. Here's a closer look at the insights I gained:
✔️ Neighbourhood Analysis: Mapped out the most popular neighbourhoods for Airbnb stays, from Manhattan’s luxurious high-rises to Brooklyn’s artsy and affordable homes.
✔️ Pricing Trends: Investigated how prices vary by neighbourhood, property type, and seasonality, providing valuable insights for potential hosts and travelers.
✔️ Availability Patterns: Analyzed which neighbourhoods have the highest booking rates and identified trends in availability across the year.
✔️ Host Insights: Explored host strategies, including pricing, property types, and how they leverage guest reviews to attract more bookings.
✔️ Guest Preferences: Identified features that guests value most, from location to amenities, and their impact on reviews and ratings.
Using Tableau, I transformed a vast and complex dataset into interactive dashboards and compelling visualizations. This project was a rewarding experience, blending technical skills with creativity to tell a story through data.
A big thanks to LPU for providing such a dynamic platform for students to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world challenges. This project has not only honed my skills in data analytics and visualization but also strengthened my problem-solving and storytelling abilities.
Feel free to explore my work, share feedback, or discuss how we can use data to drive meaningful decisions!
